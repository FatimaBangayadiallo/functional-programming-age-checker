Age Checker â€“ Functional Programming Project
This project prompts the user to enter their age and updates the UI based on their response, classifying them as a child, teenager, adult, or wise person.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
HTML

CSS

JavaScript (Functional Programming)

ðŸ§  How It Works
This project follows a functional programming approach. Hereâ€™s the breakdown:

Input Handling:
The user inputs their age through a form.

Sanitization:
The input is trimmed and converted into a number to ensure itâ€™s valid for processing.

Logic / Decision Making:
A pure function determines the user's age category and returns a message and status.

UI Update:
Another function updates the interface (text content and styling) based on the logic result.

Controller Function:
A controller function ties everything together â€” it gathers the input, processes it, and updates the UI.

âœ… Project Goals
Practice structuring code with clean, reusable functions

Strengthen understanding of pure functions and separation of concerns

Improve DOM manipulation with a functional mindset

ðŸ”š Final Thoughts
This project helped me understand how to:

Separate logic from UI

Sanitize inputs properly

Write modular and readable code using functional programming principles
